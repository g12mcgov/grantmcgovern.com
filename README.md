About
=================
In its full state, this site is a Flask application hosted on a shared VPS via A Small Orange. However, this version on github is the static implementation due to some server/python/socket.io compatibility issues I am working through now.

It's front-end was written purely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's backend component to update the chart at the top of the page is powered by Python.

It uses an SSL certificate provided by StartSSL to satisfy Dropbox Oauth2 API redirects.
